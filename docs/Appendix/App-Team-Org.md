## Meeting Coordination

1. What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?)
Isaac will send a text message 24 hours before the meeting starts as a reminder. 
1. How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?
After every meeting, the team will plan for the next meeting and where it will take place. 
1. What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?
The preferred method of meeting is virtually. Before any big presentation or event, we will have a face-to-face meeting. 
1. Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary?
A: If there is a struggle remembering meetings, events, or assignments then the team will create a shared calender to help organize and recenter the group. 
B: Any role change or added responsibility should be clearly stated in comunication (text, email, etc.) and any responsibility or task will also have written proof so that there is clear evidence that a task was asigned. 

## Roles & Responsibilities

_**Appendix Table 2**: Project Roles and Duties_

| **Role**          | **Duties**                                                                                                                                |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meeting leader: Isaac Smith    | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting                                        |
| Meeting recorder:   | Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned                          |
| Assignment leader:  | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date                                                           |
| Project monitor:    | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status |

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

If there is a conflict: 

A: In case of simple disagreemants of ideas and roles the team will vote in agreeance or dissagreeance. The opposing sides will each be given a chance to defend their standing and then the vote will take place. 
B: In case of task issues the team will refer to if there is written proof that someone is asigned to the task. If no one is asigned to the task, then the Team Leader will assign who will do the task. If a task is not completed 5 hours before the due date, then the Team Leader will complete the task with the help of the others. THere will be a penalty that is decided by the people completing the task depending on the severity and the consistency of the wrong doer. 
C: In case that there is a clear imbalance of assigned work on the project, the Team Leader will talk with the group and assign tasks based on the ability of each team menber. THe Team Leader has priority on assigning tasks unless the majority of team members still think that there is a imbalance. They will then defer to Resolution A to vote and decide an acceptable outcome. If the imbalance persists, then the team does have a right to impose a penalty depending on the severity and consistency of the wrong doer.
